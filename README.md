# Cryptocurrency Tracker Frontend

This project is a React-based frontend application that connects to a [FastAPI backend](https://github.com/yermekulyd/cryptocurrency-tracker-backend) to retrieve and display cryptocurrency data. The application uses **Axios** for making API requests, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **Ant Design** components for UI elements. It is built with **Vite** for a faster development experience.

## Features

- **API requests** using Axios to fetch cryptocurrency data from the backend.
- **useEffect Hook** for managing side effects and fetching data on component mount.
- **Props handling** for passing data between components.
- **Tailwind CSS** for easy and customizable styling.
- **Ant Design components** for modern and responsive UI elements.
